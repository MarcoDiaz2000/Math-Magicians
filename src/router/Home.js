    <h1>Welcome to Math Magicians!</h1>
    <p>
      Mathematics includes the study of such topics as quantity,
      structure, space, and change. It has no generally accepted definition.
      Mathematicians seek and use patterns to formulate new conjectures; they resolve
      the truth or falsity of such by mathematical proof.
      When mathematical structures are good models of real phenomena, mathematical
      reasoning can be used to provide insight or predictions about nature.
      Through the use of abstraction and logic, mathematics developed from counting,
      calculation, measurement, and the systematic study of the shapes and motions
      of physical objects.
